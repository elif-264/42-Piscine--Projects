This repository contains my C and Shell exercises from the **42 Piscine** program.

## 📁 Structure
- **c00 – c07** → C programming exercises, each folder contains multiple `ex` subfolders (ex00, ex01, etc.)
- **shell_00** → Shell scripting and basic command-line exercises.
- **exam** → Exam practice files.

## 🧠 Topics Covered
- Loops, conditions, and functions in C  
- Pointers and memory handling  
- String manipulation and arrays  
- Shell commands and scripting basics

## ⚙️ Notes
- Example build command for C projects:
  ```bash
  gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror your_file.c -o your_program
  
This compiles your C file into an executable named your_program.

-Wall, -Wextra, -Werror: enable strict warning checks

your_file.c: source file

-o your_program: output program name

Temporary files, compiled binaries (a.out, .exe), and system/editor files (.DS_Store, .swp, etc.) are excluded via .gitignore.
